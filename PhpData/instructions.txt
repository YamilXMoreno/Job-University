1. Make sure XAMPP is correctly installed on your computer.

2. Extract the downloaded file, locate your xampp folder on your computer, and paste the blog folder in the htdocs.

3. Open http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser and create a new user 'egator' with password 'admin1234' as we did in the video tutorial on youtube. Remember to change the login credentials in the config file in your xampp folder (xampp/phpMyAdmin/config.inc.php) to the newly created user credentials, since that's what we used to connect our database in the tutorial.

4. Create a database 'blog', and upload the SQL dump (blog-tables.sql) found in the extracted folder.

5. The credentials of all users registered in the tutorial can be found in the zip file (registered-user-credentials.txt). Use any to log in to the application, and have fun!
